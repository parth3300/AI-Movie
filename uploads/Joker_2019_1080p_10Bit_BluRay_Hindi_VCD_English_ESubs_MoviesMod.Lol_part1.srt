2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,070
The news never ends.

3
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,011
This is 1080 gcr.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,139
You get all the news you need,
all day long.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:16,933
Good morning.

6
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,228
It's 42 degrees at 10:30 on
this Thursday, October 15th.

7
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,730
I'm Stan I. Brooks,
and here's what's happening.

8
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,108
It's day 18
of the garbage strike,

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,902
with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,029
Even the nicest sections
of the city

11
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,447
are looking like slums.

12
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,324
Health commissioner
Edward o'Rourke is

13
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,118
declaring a city-wide
state of emergency

14
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,911
for the first time in decades.

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,199
There's no need to
wait until somebody dies

16
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,915
or comes down
with typhoid fever.

17
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,084
It's already
a serious situation.

18
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,354
It's something that affects

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,498
almost everyone in the city,

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,672
no matter who they are
or where they live.

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,049
You can't go down
no one Avenue

22
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,135
without seeing nothing
but garbage and rats.

23
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,530
It's starting to
affect my business

24
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,823
when customers can't get in here

25
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,639
because of
the garbage situation.

26
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,535
I'm not out that long
to smell it,

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,393
but I think to look at it,
it's terrible.

28
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,019
It don't affect me except

29
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,730
for the very bad smell here.

30
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,897
It's horrific.

31
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,274
It's a mess.

32
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,752
I've been in this country
for 50 years,

33
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,216
and I've never seen
anything like it.

34
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,820
What is this world coming to?

35
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,071
Put 'em in a room,

36
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,717
let 'em sit there and talk
until they get it over with.

37
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,950
24 hours, 48 hours,
how long it takes.

38
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,411
The idea of
the national guard moving in

39
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,954
and cleaning up is a good idea.

40
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,242
In other news,

41
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,890
the building industry
and landlords today

42
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,459
expressed concern
over the latest

43
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,335
increase in heating oil prices.

44
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,712
Renters in the Metro area

45
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,213
are certain to feel the pinch...

46
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,894
Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?

47
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,918
Nice outfit, pal.

48
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,354
If you're gonna be
a clown, at least you could be

49
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,004
a good one.
You know that, right?

50
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,317
- Hey! Hey!
- Grab it!

51
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,341
Go, go, go!

52
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,675
Hey!

53
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,052
He's coming!

54
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,721
Come on, clown, let's go!
We've got the sign.

55
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,450
- Look at him running.
- Let's go!

56
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,474
Stop them!

57
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,495
Go, go, go, go!
Watch the car, watch the car!

58
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,216
Where's your sign,
clown?

59
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,232
Hey!

60
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,071
Go, clown! Come on!

61
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,322
Stop them!

62
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,617
Go! Come on!

63
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,287
Stop them!

64
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,081
Come on, run!

65
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,584
Hey!

66
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,337
You fucking...

67
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,927
Oh, shit! Good hit.

68
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,846
Come on!
Beat his ass up.

69
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,813
Come on! This guy's weak.
He can't do nothing.

70
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,850
Harder! Harder!

71
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,268
Beat him up. Take his stuff.

72
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,687
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

73
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,160
Ha!

74
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,250
Is it just me,

75
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,921
or is it getting crazier
out there?

76
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,344
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

77
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,721
People are upset.

78
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,766
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

79
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,309
These are tough times.

80
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,730
How about you?

81
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,442
Have you been keeping up
with your journal?

82
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,988
Yes, ma'am.

83
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,907
Great.

84
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,368
Did you bring it with you?

85
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,040
Arthur.

86
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,543
Last time, I asked you
to bring your journal

87
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,294
with you for these appointments.

88
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,338
Can I see it?

89
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,186
I've been using it as a journal,

90
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,732
but also as a joke diary.

91
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,236
Funny thoughts or observations.

92
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,530
I think I told you

93
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,783
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

94
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,830
No, you didn't.

95
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,292
I think I did.

96
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,763
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."

97
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,114
How does it feel to
have to come here?

98
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,284
Does it help to
have someone to talk to?

99
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,581
I think I felt better

100
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,666
when I was locked up
in the hospital.

101
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,961
And have you thought more about

102
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,714
why you were locked up?

103
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,222
Who knows?

104
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,147
I was wondering
if you could ask the doctor

105
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,149
to increase my medication.

106
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,491
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

107
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,411
Surely,
they must be doing something.

108
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,126
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

109
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,372
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

110
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,603
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

111
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,836
Just stop.

112
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,180
What? You think that's funny?

113
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,106
I'm sorry. I have a...

114
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,907
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,080
Happy,
did you check the mail

116
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,475
before you came up?

117
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,227
Yeah, mom.

118
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,688
Nothing.

119
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,461
And finally, tonight,

120
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,486
just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse,

121
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,946
authorities are saying

122
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,490
the city is under siege
by scores of rats.

123
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,950
And not just any rats,

124
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,161
but super rats,
who are hard to kill.

125
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,246
He must not be
getting my letters.

126
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,414
Yeah.

127
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,666
It's Thomas Wayne, mom.

128
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,251
He's a busy man.

129
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,130
Please. I worked
for that family for years.

130
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,591
The least he could do
is write back.

131
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,304
Here.
Don't get all worked up. Eat.

132
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,472
You need to eat.

133
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,267
You need to eat.
Look how skinny you are.

134
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,497
Both victims
were taken to Gotham general.

135
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,646
Sounds like

136
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,875
the city needs to
find the pied Piper.

137
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,567
He'll make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

138
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,529
Oh, yeah. Everybody who?
Who do you talk to?

139
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,491
Well, everybody on the news.

140
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,826
He's the only one
who could save the city.

141
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,328
He owes it to us.

142
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,749
Come sit. It's starting.

143
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,709
Yay, Murray.

144
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:55,005
From
ncb studios in Gotham city,

145
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,467
it's live with Murray Franklin!

146
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,554
Tonight, Murray welcomes
Sandra winger...

147
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,931
Oh, Sandra winger's on.

148
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,226
And the piano stylings
of yeldon and Chantel.

149
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,520
Joining Murray, as always,

150
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,272
Ellis drane
and his jazz orchestra.

151
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,109
And now, without further ado,

152
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,028
Murray Franklin.

153
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,167
Thank you.

154
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,461
Thank you.

155
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,964
We got a great-looking
audience tonight.

156
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,258
Yeah!

157
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,135
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

158
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,636
Thank you.

159
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,722
So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

160
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,225
- are in Gotham now, right?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,687
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

162
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,397
You ready for this?

163
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,648
Super cats.

164
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,798
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

165
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,322
I love you, Murray!

166
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,492
I love you, too.

167
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,996
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

168
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,164
Who is that?

169
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,499
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

170
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,585
Stand up for me.

171
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,752
Go ahead.

172
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,634
What's your name?

173
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,179
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

174
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,014
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

175
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,909
Oh, okay. Well, there's
something special about you,

176
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,975
Arthur, I could tell.

177
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,143
Where are you from?

178
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,020
I live right here in the city

179
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,148
with my mother.

180
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,418
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

181
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,586
There's nothing funny
about that.

182
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,278
I lived with my mother before
I made it. Just me and her.

183
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,281
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

184
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,449
and he never came back.

185
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,575
Aww.

186
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,660
I know
what that's like, Murray.

187
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,371
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

188
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,290
I take good care of my mother.

189
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,380
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

190
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,548
She does.

191
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:06,261
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

192
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,056
She says I was put here
to spread joy and laughter.

193
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,599
Aww.

194
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,977
Wow.

195
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,483
I like that. I like that
a lot. Come on down.

196
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,486
Come on. For that,
you gotta come down.

197
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,131
Come on! Come on.

198
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,038
Come on.

199
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,514
Okay, we got a big show
tonight. Stay tuned.

200
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,474
We'll be right back.

201
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,643
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

202
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,562
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

203
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,938
It made my day.

204
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,314
Thanks, Murray.

205
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,400
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

206
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,776
the audience, all that stuff?

207
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,171
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

208
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,362
to have a kid like you.

209
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,967
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

210
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,658
Another day in chuckle town.

211
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,826
Yup.

212
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,456
You okay?

213
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,918
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

214
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,754
Fucking savages.

215
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,716
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

216
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,842
No.

217
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,345
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

218
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,846
All the crazy shit out there.

219
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,098
They're animals.

220
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,896
You know what?

221
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,152
Here.

222
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,072
What is it?

223
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,615
Take it.

224
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,617
It's for you.

225
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,040
You gotta
protect yourself out there.

226
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,292
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

227
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,087
Randall,

228
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,174
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

229
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,177
Don't sweat it, art.

230
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,221
No one has to know.

231
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,723
And you can pay me back
some other time.

232
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,100
You know you're my boy.

233
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,311
Arthur,

234
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,438
hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

235
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,692
Hey, Gary. You know
what I've always wondered?

236
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,984
No idea.

237
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,986
Do you people call it
miniature golf

238
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,530
or is it just golf to you?

239
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,286
Punch him in the dick,
Gary.

240
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,888
Hello, hoyt.

241
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,558
Gary said you wanted to see me.

242
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,644
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

243
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,770
Not quite.

244
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,064
Just been
working on my material.

245
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,150
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

246
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,818
Look, I like you, Arthur.

247
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,403
You know, a lot of the guys,

248
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,127
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

249
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,657
I don't even know
why I like you.

250
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,951
But I got another complaint.

251
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,455
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's music.

252
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,457
The guy said you disappeared.

253
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,000
Never even returned his sign.

254
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,669
Because I got jumped.

255
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,755
Didn't you hear?

256
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,673
For a sign?

257
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,009
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

258
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,136
Just get him his sign back.

259
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,680
He's going out of business,
for god's sake, Arthur.

260
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,640
Why would I keep his sign?

261
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,560
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

262
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,855
If you don't return the sign,

263
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,065
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

264
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,276
Are we clear?

265
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,572
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

266
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,699
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

267
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,242
The other guys,

268
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,167
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

269
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,205
because people
think you're weird.

270
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,208
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

271
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,050
Wait, wait, wait.

272
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,218
Wait.

273
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,597
Thank you.

274
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,205
This building is so awful,
isn't it?

275
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,543
This building is so awful,
right, mommy?

276
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,129
Yes, we can hear you, gigi.

277
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,631
It's so awful, mommy.

278
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,342
Right, mommy?

279
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,810
- Good night.
- This building's

280
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,163
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

281
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,651
Hey.

282
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,367
Come on.

283
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,964
The moon is a silver dollar

284
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,051
shining up in the sky

285
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,678
that's the dream we can buy...

286
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,083
- Look up.
- Mmm.

287
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,223
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

288
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,268
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

289
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,467
What do you think he's gonna do?

290
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,897
He's gonna help us.

291
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,985
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

292
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,029
Why would he help us?

293
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,782
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

294
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,243
If he knew how we were living,

295
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,872
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

296
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,918
I can't explain it to you
any better than that.

297
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,672
I don't want you worrying
about money, mom.

298
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,132
Or me.

299
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,759
Everybody's telling me

300
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,470
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

301
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,265
But, happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

302
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,476
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

303
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,938
Don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

304
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,761
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

305
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,180
the world is in a mess

306
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,558
with politics and taxes
and people grinding axes

307
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,809
there's no happiness

308
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,354
happiness is not a riddle

309
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,232
when I'm listening to that
big bass fiddle

310
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,579
Slap that bass
slap it till its dizzy

311
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,998
slap that bass
keep the rhythm busy

312
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,876
zoom, zoom, zoom
misery, you've got to go...

313
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,836
Hey, what's your name?

314
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,047
Arthur.

315
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,301
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.

316
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,136
I know.

317
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,930
You know who's not?
Him.

318
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,480
Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

319
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,689
Mom, what?

320
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,983
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

321
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,402
I'm watching an old war movie!

322
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,071
Turn it down!

323
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,572
Um...

324
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,120
Sorry, mom.

325
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,967
You good?

326
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,871
It's nice to see these couples
out at my show.

327
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,040
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

328
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,835
- Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

329
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,503
My favorite one right now is

330
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,631
professor and senior
who really needs

331
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,049
to pass my class to graduate.

332
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,468
Yes.

333
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,305
So, I'll tell you how I operate.

334
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,598
I'm a professor at

335
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,201
a prestigious
new england university...

336
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,605
And my wife is a senior
in my "intro to western civ."

337
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,816
I know. I know.

338
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,153
Why is she a senior in the
intro? I didn't buy it either.

339
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,114
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

340
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,883
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

341
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,244
She says,
"excuse me, professor Lewis."

342
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,330
I can't use my real last name
at this college

343
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,040
'cause they don't hire Jews.

344
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,126
It's something I'll address

345
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,836
once I have tenure,
but for now...

346
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,172
She says,
"excuse me, professor Lewis,

347
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,567
I think I might be
in danger of failing

348
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,799
your 'intro to western civ, '

349
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,092
and I just want you to know

350
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,928
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

351
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,140
And I said, "anything?"
And she said...

352
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,917
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

353
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,461
Were you following me today?

354
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,758
Yeah.

355
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,470
I thought that was you.

356
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,724
I was hoping you'd come in
and Rob the place.
